               <p>Fishing has always been a peaceful activity for me. When I was younger I would travel
               to an old lake house on a tiny private hunting club pond and fish with my brother and 
               grandfather. Some days the water would be so full of algae you could hardly reel in the line
               without catching a "lake monster". The days were hot and muggy in the summer and often you
               would stand in the shad of a tree as you waited for a bite that never came. Even the fish
               couldn't stand the heat. Other days the air would be wet and muggy, with overcast skys and
               muddy banks. The rain would start to fall just as you were pulling the bass and catfish
               out of the pond like fish in a barrel. Sometimes we went up to the lake in the fall or 
               winter and fished amid the gray and brown hues. Once my brother fished from one of the
               small<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;decaying docks located in the far shore of the pond and
               cast and<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;somehow fell into the freezing water with one hand
               holding the edge of<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the dock and other hand holding
               his pole. My grandfather rushed over<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; to save him and after 
               pulling him out and getting him some oversized dry clothes told him he was a great 
               fisherman because he didn't lose the pole. My grandfather grew up in rural Missouri, 
               he loved to fish. I remember he told us that his favorite fishing story when he was a 
               kid was getting a new pole with a reel. Before he had only fished with a cane pole and 
               so when he got a fish on his brand new reeled fishing pole he didn't reel the fish in but
               ran back up onto the bank like it was a cane pole. He also told us about making a 
               cane pole when he was a boy and catching two bluegill on either side of a slice of apple 
               that he had placed on hisi<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; homemade thorn hook. My
               grandfather even in his seventies was<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; proud of that fact. 
               The lake and fishing were very interwined, during<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; my childhood
               90% of the times I fished I fished at that small pond.<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After 
               fishing or during an interlude I would try to catch frogs, I couldn't catch the 
               huge bullfrogs, but in the spring these tiny baby frogs came out and I tried to grab them
               and catch them by the handful. while many slipped through my fingers eventually I caught 
               one and then lost in  the car on the way home. I never did figure out where the frog
               ended up. Probably in frog heaven with the heat.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;I also 
               remember walking the hunting loop with friends and family<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 
               and collecting the rusted out shotgun shells that they used to hunt the<br>&emsp;&emsp;
               &emsp;&emsp;ducks with. Going up to the lake was a magical place, unforuntely as<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I got older trips got less frequent and I got more busy. 
               This year<br> &emsp;before leaving for college I got to go up their one more time, it felt
               like a farewell<br>&emsp;as any other to my childhood. Someday I will fish again.</p>
