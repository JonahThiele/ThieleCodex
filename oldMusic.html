                   <p>I find folk music charming. It seems a world different than &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   modern pop or rap and seems to speak to my soul. I think this &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;interests 
                   orignates from a minor obession with the past and &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;people's 
                   perceived happiness back then. The songs are simple, and rough much like life over a 
                   century ago. These songs create&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a certain nostalgia for
                   the simpler time. This longing for the past&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; is actually
                   not new as seen in the Song Cottage by the Sea &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; sung by
                   the folk singer Frank Fairfield. But in many ways the&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp; 
                   2000's and beyond seem different. Pop music and rap is dominant and the content of these songs 
                   seems extremely vapid. Even country which is a direct descendant of folk, just focuses
                   on a few topics: alcohol, tractors, dogs, and romance. Older Folk instead feel more
                   human. It's subject matter is war, romance, moral issues, serial<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&ensp;killers, fear, absurdity, and many more. On the whole folk<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;music tries to capture the varied experience of life. The evils,the<br>
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; evil and goodness, the random occurences. Modern music 
                   just<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;seems to capture the monotonous angst of people
                   that merely want a distraction from the world. Folk songs feel like some sort of stimulate
                   they increase your mood, and give to a kind of respect for the chaotic nature of life. The 
                   content of a folk song might include a murder by a lover, but it has a catchy tune, and 
                   seems nature given the circumstances of the song. A rap song might talk about a person 
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;getting wasted or high at a party and how they
                   are living the life&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;, but it doesn't feel real. The content of modern
                   music seems&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; stuck between two modes partying and short term 
                   pleasure(i.e. modern romance) and angst related to not being happy. In many ways these
                   songs represent the cultural experience of many of our generation. The songs feel desperate
                   they don't feel joyful or like a full expression of real life. While trying to provide
                   an escape from modernity it appears to serve the same beliefs and experiences. Folk instead
                   serves reality in a digestable way<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;to the audience. It 
                   pairs evil(thematically dark songs) often with<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;upbeat music,
                   and upbeat songs often with realistic twists. The<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;songs all
                   have a sort of dialogue, a story. They have a defined purpose, or defined lack of purpose.
                   Most modern songs don't seem to have that. Those that do have purpose, often tell bland
                   and shallow stories or at least less nuanced and open stories. Overall I enjoy this genre
                   because it tries to connect to the human spirit and human experience. I find it soul
                   pleasing.<p>
