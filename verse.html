              <p> Share in suffering as a good soldier of christ Jesus, No soldier
              gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the 
              one that enlisted him. An athlete is not crowned unless he competes
              according to the rules. It is the hard-working farmer who ought to 
              have the first share of crops. - 2 Timothy 2:3-6</p>
