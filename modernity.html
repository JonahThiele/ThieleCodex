             <p>We live in an era deemed beyond history. In many ways&emsp;&ensp; the west is suffering the affects of avoiding human nature
             or simply believing that we are not held to the same &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;constraints are our forfathers.The Age we live in has many
             amenities than past generations could only imagine and many that they could not. However, it has come at the cost of our cohesion
             a society and community. We live in a world where no major world wars have been fought for nearly 90 years, where<br>
             &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;modern medicine has displaced plagues, aging, and starvation. All staples of the pre-modern world. And yet we<br> 
             &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;live in the most unhappy and anti-social era in the history of the world. Most western nations<br> 
             &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;have low fertility rates and 
             rapid community decline. In many ways the internet has falicitated this collaspe, but I feel it has
             more to do with the decline in belief. Belief in our neighbors, nation, duty, God, and purpose. The world is a different place
             since world wars in terms of neighbors. A majority of people live in cities of adjacent to them and hardly know or understand
             them. This is completely opposite&emsp;&emsp; of the majority of human history when we lived and died
             in small bands of close knit family. With the rise of&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
             secularism after WII, people have also become a lot less religious. This hasfurther reduced
             a possible outlet for &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;community. To supplement this lack of community most people use the internet
             However, this community is often&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; not real or personal. Instead it is often full of frustrated people
             trying to find a fix for their loneliness through &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;radicalism or mere distractions.
             This lack of belief has also affected our belief in our nation, both in terms of&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
             government and people. We don't understand or love our neighbors and so we&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; believe that they are destroying
             our nation because they have a different view of it. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On the left it is a continually commitment to
             progress, on the right a&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
             reversion to tradition. Neither worldview is complete. As a people we have
             no &ensp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;idea what it is to be American. The idea seems to have been reduced to merely the 
             liberal&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;idea of "being who you are" or "doing as you please". While personal freedom is
             &ensp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;important people when given freedom will always make the wrong decision. They 
             &ensp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;need to be grounded in something first. Religion
             would normally provide this, however we live in one of the most
             &ensp;&emsp;&emsp; secular ages in history. Most churches
             seem to be mostly clubs for old people and feel devoid of energy or growth.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A people that only believe
             In being something become nothing. They have no alliance to ideals or others outside of&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; their group
             The decline of duty has is tied to religion. People need to have the law: an ideal to measure oneself&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;against.
             Without a moral ideal it is hard to enforce a sense of duty, both to God and to nation. Modernity and the isolation
            it creates also has in many cases endless pleasure and distractions that allow people to shirk such duty and
           reponsibility. Without duty people are less bound to each other on a personal level. The divorce rates in 
          this nation are incrediblity high due to this. With no duty to each other as a population most young 
         people don't believe in duty to a nation. People are not willing to die for a national ideals, or beliefs.
        Again American christainity is on the decline, which is negative for the spiritual health and mental health 
       of our nation. People need hope, the cross provides that. Without hope, joy, and solid community: people
      respond negatively. Either they don't see a real reason to exist, the decide to distract themselves from
     the gaping void of death and disasifaction, or they fill the void with some other religionish movement.
    This can be seen in will the rise of radicalism on both sides of the aisle. They try to fill the spiritual hole
   without using Jesus. They movements are caustic, both to their disciples and to the country as a whole.
  They don't seek to uphold a moral standard or seek reconciliation or forgiveness. These "new age" religions
 create no real, holy, and meaningful purpose. People need a purpose in life: a quest to pursue. Most people 
especially in modernity feel like their livehood doesn't provide this. People working blue collar, and white
collar jobs watch as their live passes them by without seeing any present indication that they will be remembered 
after they die. They have no ideal, stories, or belief in a greater power or greater story than their own 
lives that become a legacy. Modernity provides a restful, distracted life in theory, but it lacks the pain,
the trial, the perservance that is required of an interesting and fruitful life. However, despite this seemly
nihilistic view of our modern era and the social upheaval, their is hope. A return to discipline, to God, and hope 
is what we need to pursue in the face of modernity. Whether the Lord returns in the near future or in hundred
years, we must commit to study, to discipline and to belief in a better future that we can create with the help
of God.
