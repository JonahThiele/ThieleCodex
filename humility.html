          <p>With the pursuit of knowledge or skills, people measure themselves against others within their<br> 
          community of interest. Often dwelling on the ability of others creates two outcomes, either a rat<br> race to the
          bottom or stagnation. The former is caused by people looking at an end product before<br> they have begun and
          believing that they should be better than that. This notion is detrimental,<br> while their are people that are
          naturally talented in specific areas, through dedication most can<br> become skilled in the area they desire, for
          others it just might take longer or be less natural. But<br> 
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if they study hard and believe in their ability to reach their goals, they will learn<br> 
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and grow. The latter is caused by a superiority complex. They think that they have<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; made it and therefore that their growth is done. This is a poisonous attitude.<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;People should be continually looking to grow and develope. Simply, you will never<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; be the best in the world at that skill, accept it and move on. Don't have a<br> 
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;mindset of being the absolute best, instead enjoy the process, learn the<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;skills, find passion, because in the end that will bring you more joy.<br>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It will be an endless struggle, so you should revel in it.</p>
