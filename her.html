                   <p>Human interaction and interpersonal relationship are essential for a happy and 
                   fulfiled life as a human. People are at their core social animals, even introverts 
                   and those that dislike large social gatherings still have an innate desire for community
                   and connection. One part of this desire for connection is the desire for a companion.
                   one that can walk through life alongside yourself and make the suffering of the 
                   human experience more bearable. Someone which to have a deeper connection with than 
                   just your ordinary friends and acquaintances. Someone of the opposite gender who you 
                   can "create a life with". Now this notion has been a part of the human experience
                   from the begining and people have been in monomogous relationships in the west since
                   the middle ages. God created marriage as a binding of two people into "one flesh" and 
                   the idea that people should have a partner is biblical. God saw that man should have
                   a partner and took Adam's rib and made Eve. Unfortunely in this era of human history
                   so much is stacked against both genders having fulfiled relationships. The collaspe of 
                   a healthy standard of relationships probably started in the 60s in the west, but now
                   in the 2020s has become a faucet of our culture. As a man I don't have nearly as much
                   knowledge about the dating issues of women, but I will try to address them throughout
                   this ramble. For men dating as a zoomer is unlike anything else in history. It is a 
                   game in which their are practically no winners. The most common way that people interact
                   today is through the internet, and most people also find<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   relationships through the internet. Apps like<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   Bumble, Tinder, and others dominate this space and<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   monetize the relationship game. This is unlike most<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   of human history, where people had communities or<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   fammilies that would know the personalities of the<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   two people and try to set up dates that would work.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   Or people would date within these community<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   groups. This worked well because people didn't have<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   insanely high expectations and trusted their<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   communities to find people that were relativelyi<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   compatable because they knew each other well<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   enough. This is not the case with dating apps like<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   tinder, in which you see only what a girl looks like and<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   get to select someone mostly on looks who you would<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   be interested in dating. For guys these apps are<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                   usually very difficult to try to get "matches" on. Women
                   have more expectations than they did even 50ish years ago because of the internet which
                   makes it easier to access way more men. So your average guy just has little to no chance.
                   Women if given the chance will want to have a relationship with a 6 foot, 6 figure charismatic
                   guy over an average joe if that is all they<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   know about the two parties. But these dating apps use looks first to decide who you want<br>
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to "match" with so that doesn't happen. Even
                   if you manage to get over the issue of<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   getting a date through these dating apps, most girls just want to hookup. They are not<br>
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;looking for a long-term relationship with a smuck like 
                   you because your don't have the<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;afformentioned 
                   qualifications. Those that are looking for a long-term relationship on<br>&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;these apps are usually women have decided that they want
                   to settle down or that have been through some terrible relationships. As a man this
                   situation is not ideal, because we want someone that is marriage material and both of 
                   situations are the complete opposite. Finding a high quality women is not even really
                   based on looks in my opinion. Most men would be okay marrying a 5 if they had marriageable
                   qualities, like good moral character, a genuine care for others, and the same set of values.
                   But those are qualities which are not selected for my the system we currently have. 
                   Instead society has told men that they are worthless and not needed, and women that they
                   can do no wrong. which is encouraging the destructive traits that we currently see in 
                   the dating market.Even worse is the idea of anxiety mitigating strategies in dating.
                   For example asking a date to a date over text. Or having multiple conversations with women
                   at the same time to hedge your bets in terms of finding a relationship. These tactics in
                   my opinion are terrible, because your not acting honorably and taking the required risk.
                   But oftentimes these strageties fail as well. As a guy navigating dating and relationships
                   could count almost as a part-time job. Unforuntely I won't<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   &emsp;&ensp; have the same standard of life as my grandparents, the society owes us nothing
                   in this<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;brave new world. For better or for worse 
                   all you can do is trust God and improve<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;yourself.</p>
