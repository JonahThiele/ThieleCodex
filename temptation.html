                   <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Man is by nature fallen. People are born<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;children of wrath, hate, and evil.
               We fall<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; into temptation, we actively commit these<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;sins or aimlessly defile outselves.
               However, due to the<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; grace and mercy that
               we receive through christ we become a new 
               creation. Our sins are forgiven through the death of our savior. However, we still 
               toil and wrestle with the nature of sin, even after salvation. We are still tempted.<br>
               &emsp;Despite this supposed<br>&emsp; new spirit, I have failed.<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;I am wrestly addicted to this sin, 
               These past couple of days<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; I have had more time to reflect on God and the bible, and 
               yet<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; these past two days I once again partook in the sin that
               I<br>&emsp; had been avoiding for
               a week. I don't know the answer to this<br>&emsp;&ensp; affliction, but it eats away at me. I look at
               my readings at night and<br>&emsp;&ensp; am haunted by my actions, I feel the spirit
               tugging on my 
               heart, and<br>&emsp;&ensp; yet I wantonly defile myself. How do I rid myself of this divison,
               I<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
               <br><br><br><br> feel
               guilty praying and reading,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; because I feel as&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
               though I will commit, what I ought&ensp; not
               to the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;next day or the near future and can't
               &emsp;&emsp; reconcile&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; that with being close to God.
               My actions are<br> sinful, and yet I talk to God as if to<br> ignore them. Why do I cling,
               to what is good<br> and holy so weakly. Every opporunity presents&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; itself and I take 
               what is evil. I don't have a clear solution to this,&emsp;&emsp; I pray, I try to fight aginst
               my evil mind and spirit. I ought to try harder. 
               Lord, Clear my heart and mind of this terrible affliction. Help me to keep your 
               will and purpose at the forefront of my life this upcoming week. Keep me on the 
               short and narrow path, while directing my thoughs to you and that which is holy.
               Help me to emulate your character in what I think, say, and act. Ultimately, take 
               this wretched soul and let me present your glory to the world. I rest in your
               transforming love, mercy, and grace which I so great need and justly can never diserve.
               May your will be done Lord.&emsp;Amen</p>
