              <h1>Perception of Rural Living</h1>

               <div class="inner-container">
               <p>I have always been interested in living in a rural area. The main appeals being the proximity to nature, owning
               property, and the isolationism. This rural nostaligia likely stems from an early childhood in a smaller town
               and also having a love for the outdoors. But recently I have become more interested in rural living. This year I leave for college in a 
               small town in the middle of nowhere and as a city boy am prepared to test if my idealized notions of such living are real or
               fantasy. Rural life seems natural to humanity, as we have lived in small towns and villages for most of our history. 
               Cities are modern yet sterile. They have all the cool entertainment, and yet seem to lack the necessities
               to have a fullifilled life. I can easily watch a 4k HD movie on the big screen in an urban setting,but I can't watch the night sky and the beauty of
               nature in the way that my forefathers experienced. I am also not completely naive, as I realize that their are so
               many more complexities and social changes to daily life in a rural area. Life is imperfect and human wherever you roam. But,
               hopefully in such a setting while allow me to move beyond perceptions into experience.</p>
