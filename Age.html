                   <p>Since moving into college one thing that has troubled me is the feeling of immaturity,
                   both in the people around me and also myself. No really<br> connected to knowledge or understanding
                   class<br> or conceptual material, but just childishness. I don't feel any different than highschool
                   and examining the actions of my peers they appear to have a same or similar mindset.
                   Funnily enough their appears to be the same highschool cliches and groups that occupy the university.
                   There is the weird kids, the nerds, and the athletes. With significant tribalism between groups.
                   Honestly College feels more like a Disnery Original Movie than my 
                   actual highschool did. Before comming to college I had this notion that college helped cultivate adulthood, 
                   responsiblity and a general growth. I'm probably too nihilistic, but that is not what it appears.
                   It is probably a stupid conception of growing up. Moving to a campus of other kids is not going to create
                   a "well-round" well defined mam. Instead it is the reponse to the life experiences that transforms people 
                   from boys to Men. I find it interesting that on the cross-country team during workouts other teams would 
                   congradulate and encourage with the phrase "Lets go Men". It felt weird for me to be captured by this phrase.
                   Like I am 18, but I don't feel like a individual person not tied to my parents to familial expectations. 
                   It seems oddly familiar like the phrase "Lets go boys" which I heard a lot at cross meets in highschool, yet 
                   alien. It almost feel<br> &emsp;&emsp;to me like adulthood is being thrust on to me and yet I feel unprepared and confused.
                   At college<br> &emsp;&emsp;it becomes painful clear that, my life could end up on a completely different trajectory than 
                   the<br> &emsp;&emsp;rest of my family. I think what is terrifying is that fact that the only relationships in my life that
                   are set in stone is family. Like as<br> much as sometimes I dislike the<br> &emsp;&emsp;actions of or disagree with they are 
                   still going to be their or be a part of me, but everything else<br> &emsp;&emsp;could all only be temporary. Honestly I have made some interesting 
                   friends so far both on and<br> &emsp;&emsp;off the team, however, I feel myself holdling back, because in many ways I am 
                   terrified in investing into friendships or relationships that will end, much as my highschool and middleschool friendships
                   ended, with time and distance moving on. I think that is what really<br> &emsp;&emsp;what drives my perception of immaturity, people here
                   seem to live lifes of<br> &emsp;&emsp;quickening pace, over things that I think ought to last forever( the aftformentioned<br>
                   &emsp;&emsp;relationships and friendships).
                   I feel like its a funny juxaposition though. College in this town<br> &emsp;&emsp;clashes against the nature of youth with the nature of a small town.
                   I'm a fast paced college kid with a burnout attention span and stressful classes living in a town that has<br> stood not only nature
                   and time, but generations as well. Ulimately a bit of<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
                   immaturity comes from what I feel is the my own<br>
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;inadequateness in terms of 
                   background knowledge and<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;skills. I don't seem to 
                   understand the programming problems or ideas 
                   as wholly as my cohort. I need extra time to complete the first tasks. Overall, I need to the learn 
                   the basics, while my classmates seem to be flying along with blazing fast speed and knowledge. A lot of this is caught 
                   up in  being in a different<br> pond. A pond where the people are as passionate or more<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;passionate  compared  to me about
                   computer science, Which actual is a good thing: I am<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;where I am supposed to be if is as interested as me. Also I tend to not think
                   about how<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; much others had to put in with training and growth. When I look at those more mature<br>
                   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;than me in knowledge or wisdom
                   or just pure age they usually have gained that through<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;practice or difficult experience. Maturity and Wisdom is not something
                   that a comfortable<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;person gains. It is something that a battle hardened warrior, adventurer or an explorer discovers within himself
                   that he had previously not known. In the end I need to keep a clear heart and mind and realize that it is okay that I am not a 
                   finished product, the greatest craftsman in the world is still molding my heart and soul and even if I haven't grown in 
                   reccent years<br> my person is still under development.When my own childness becomes<br> apparent or I feel very inadeqaint, I have to turn 
                   to the Lord, to search for<br> his direction and comfort. It reminds me  of the story of Elisha when<br> the king of Syria wanted to 
                   find him in Dothan. They surrounded<br> the city with chariots and horses and when asked by his servant<br> what they should do. He answered
                   "We have more on our side than<br> they have on theirs" and prayed that God would open his eyes and<br> he saw "the hillside covered with
                   horses and chariots of fire all<br> around Elisha" Lord help me to see your in my childness and<br> weakness and see the army that fights for me.
                   Amen.<p>
