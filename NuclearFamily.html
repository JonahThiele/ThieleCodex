                   <p>I believe that it the motivation of most young men to create a family.
                   Maybe its the nature of human lust and biological wiring or some innate 
                   mission from God, either way, it is seemingly unabtainable for most. Generation
                   Z comes from one most fractured marriage demographics. A majority of Gen Z grows up
                   in single parent homes or in the aftermath of a bad marriage or no marriage at all.
                   How is this generation supposed to create healthy relationships, cultivate healthy
                   relationships if they have grown up in the absence of them. On top of this legacy
                   issue male singleness is at an all time hight, with the average marriage age being 
                   well into the thirtys compared to the 20s only 2 decades ago. Most people waive such
                   statisics off however, either retorting with the infamous "Touch Grass more" or that
                   such statsitics are just a function of a progressive society that has ultimately
                   liberated women and men and therefore the idea of marriage is just outdated. Both of 
                   these are bad arguments. Firstly a majority of people now-a-days use the internet to 
                   court each other(Which has many downsides) which is super skewed against men, and also
                   doesn't usually promote long lasting, or natural relationship. Mainly these apps act
                   as sex on demand, which is counter to a family ideal. Second you rarely meet people 
                   outside in random encounters. Life happens, people keep their heads down go about life
                   and ultimately move on. Even meeting young people is difficult nowadays, our 
                   population pyramid is a bit uneven due to the baby-boomer generation and the low
                   fertitly rates of the past couple of decades. The only way to meet people is 
                   through groups where you know their will be young people. The top place this occurs
                   is college. But that often depends on the composition of your college(men to women ratios
                   ) and also quite often the quality(I mean so not the physical sense, but a spiritual
                   and moral sense) of the women on campus. This is also at a time with a majority of 
                   women not interested in relationships or at least not with men. The Second argument is 
                   mainly wrapped up in the belief of a fundamental march of progress, that man is better
                   than those that came before them and therefore that this era is enlightened and knows
                   what is fundamentally best for it. This is an immature notion: while the past should not
                   always be glorified it should remain a measuring rod for human behavior. Marriage and
                   family has a purpose, Not only did God ordain it, but it has been part of the human
                   experience since the begining. You can't rip that out without expecting issues to arise.
                   People are invested in a society when they are married. Marriage not only allows to the
                   continuation of the species, but also gives people a stake in their communities and 
                   society. They have a reason to work half to death, Because at the end of the day, they
                   can come home to a family. Without this purpose, people decide to opt out of society as
                   a whole or even worse they decide to destroy the sociey because they have nothing to lose.
                   Marriage represents a state of rest, equalibrim(now marriage is obiviously not going to 
                   be easy or honey-moon like), people like any object want to return to this state. A
                   nation of these restles men does not bode well. They don't have a reason to support the
                   status quo, because it doesn't sasify an innate human desire for connection, relationship
                   and intimacy. Honestly I have no idea of a possible solution for this condition. I don't 
                   know how we get out of this hole. I just know that their is a definite hole that can't 
                   be ignored any longer, and also that if this situation persists, things could go south 
                   very quickly. People have died over far lesser needs than mans need to be know and connected.</p>
